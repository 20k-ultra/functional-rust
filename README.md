# Functional programming examples

This repository contains examples of solved coding challenges that show functional programming features in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language such as [Closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)), [iterators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator), and [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching).

You can find a README inside each challenge that explains the problem and tests that verify the solution.
